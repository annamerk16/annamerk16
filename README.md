ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anna!
ðŸŽ“ Senior at CUNY Hunter College, studying Computer Science
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software Engineer

I love tackling challenging coding problems and I hope to continue to learn and build my skills. Through my UI/UX internship and my experience as a Break Through Tech Fellow through Cornell Tech, I am continuously growing my technical and leadership skills. Currently, I am the Scrum Master for my team at my internship. I have also just successfully finished up the Machine Learning Foundations Course for the Break Through Tech AI/ML program. As a result, I will soon be getting my ML Foundations certificate from Cornell University. Being a Break Through Tech fellow has allowed me to develop good time management skills, as well as improving my skills in leadership, communication, collaboration, and problem solving.

I am looking to leverage and grow my skills in a software engineering internship, where I can contribute to meaninful projects and learn from industy professionals. If anyone ever wants to reach out, feel free to!

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
I have two tuxedo cats that I love more than anything in the world. I spend majority of my free time going on long walks in a park or reading a fantasy book. My go-to sweet treat is an iced oatmilk vanilla latte with an almond croissant.
